## 1. Naming Best Practices
### 1.1.  Use Intention-Revealing Names
- Names should convey purpose, usage, and meaning. Avoid ambiguous or generic names.
- Replace cryptic names with descriptive ones that do not require additional comments.
```python
# Good
elapsed_time_in_days = 7
days_since_creation = 10

# Bad
d = 7  # elapsed time
```

### 1.2. Avoid Disinformation
- Avoid misleading names or words with established meanings that don’t align with your intent.
- Ensure names clearly differentiate between similar concepts.
```python
# Good
account_group = [account1, account2]

# Bad
account_list = {key: value}  # Misleading, not a list
```

### 1.3. Make Meaningful Distinctions
- Avoid arbitrary changes, like adding numbers or noise words.
- Use names that highlight the purpose and differences between entities.
```python
# Good  
def copy_chars(source, destination):
    for i in range(len(source)):
        destination[i] = source[i]

# Bad
def copy_chars(a1, a2):
    for i in range(len(a1)):
        a2[i] = a1[i]
```

### 1.4. Use Pronounceable Names
- Choose names that are easy to pronounce.
- This helps facilitate clear communication during discussions and to reduce onboarding time for new developers.
```python
# Good
pswdExpDt = "2024-12-31"

# Bad
password_expiration_date = "2024-12-31"
```

### 1.4. Use Searchable Names
- Avoid single-letter names or numeric constants that are difficult to locate.
- Use descriptive, searchable names.
```python
# Good
WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5
HOURS_PER_DAY = 4
TASK_COUNT = 7

for task_index in range(TASK_COUNT):
    total += values[task_index] * HOURS_PER_DAY / WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK

# Bad
for i in range(7):
    total += values[i] * 4 / 5
```

### 1.5. Avoid Encodings
- Do not add unnecessary type or scope encodings (e.g., m_ or Hungarian Notation).
- Modern tools and languages provide better ways to distinguish variable types and scope.
```python
# Good
class Part:
    def __init__(self):
        self.description = ""

# Bad
class Part:
    def __init__(self):
        self.m_description = ""
```

### 1.6. Avoid Mental Mapping
- Use clear, explicit names instead of abstract placeholders or single letters.
```python
# Good
url_without_host = "example.com/path"

# Bad
r = "example.com/path"  # What does r mean?
```

### 1.7. Add Meaningful Context
- Provide context through class, function, or variable names. Avoid gratuitous prefixes or unnecessary context.
```python
# Good
class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city, state, zip_code):
        pass

# Bad
class GSDAddress:
    def __init__(self, gsd_street, gsd_city, gsd_state, gsd_zip_code):
        pass
```

### 1.8. Don’t Be Cute or Pun
- Avoid clever or humorous names that may not be clear to others.
```python
# Good
def delete_items():
    pass

# Bad
def holy_hand_grenade():
    pass
```
