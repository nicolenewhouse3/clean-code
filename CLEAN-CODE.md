## Introduction

## 1. Naming 
- Good naming requires descriptive skills and cultural understanding.
- Regularly refactor code to improve naming and readability.
- Clear, intentional names make code easier to understand and maintain over the long term.
  
### 1.1.  Use Intention-Revealing Names
- Names should convey purpose, usage, and meaning. Avoid ambiguous or generic names.
- Replace cryptic names with descriptive ones that do not require additional comments.
```python
# Good
elapsed_time_in_days = 7
days_since_creation = 10

# Bad
d = 7  # elapsed time
```

### 1.2. Avoid Disinformation
- Avoid misleading names or words with established meanings that don’t align with your intent.
- Ensure names clearly differentiate between similar concepts.
```python
# Good
account_group = [account1, account2]

# Bad
account_list = {key: value}  # Misleading, not a list
```

### 1.3. Make Meaningful Distinctions
- Avoid arbitrary changes, like adding numbers or noise words.
- Use names that highlight the purpose and differences between entities.
```python
# Good  
def copy_chars(source, destination):
    for i in range(len(source)):
        destination[i] = source[i]

# Bad
def copy_chars(a1, a2):
    for i in range(len(a1)):
        a2[i] = a1[i]
```

### 1.4. Use Pronounceable Names
- Choose names that are easy to pronounce.
- This helps facilitate clear communication during discussions and to reduce onboarding time for new developers.
```python
# Good
pswdExpDt = "2024-12-31"

# Bad
password_expiration_date = "2024-12-31"
```

### 1.4. Use Searchable Names
- Avoid single-letter names or numeric constants that are difficult to locate.
- Use descriptive, searchable names.
```python
# Good
WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5
HOURS_PER_DAY = 4
TASK_COUNT = 7

for task_index in range(TASK_COUNT):
    total += values[task_index] * HOURS_PER_DAY / WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK

# Bad
for i in range(7):
    total += values[i] * 4 / 5
```

### 1.5. Avoid Encodings
- Do not add unnecessary type or scope encodings (e.g., m_ or Hungarian Notation).
- Modern tools and languages provide better ways to distinguish variable types and scope.
```python
# Good
class Part:
    def __init__(self):
        self.description = ""

# Bad
class Part:
    def __init__(self):
        self.m_description = ""
```

### 1.6. Avoid Mental Mapping
- Use clear, explicit names instead of abstract placeholders or single letters.
```python
# Good
url_without_host = "example.com/path"

# Bad
r = "example.com/path"  # What does r mean?
```

### 1.7. Add Meaningful Context
- Provide context through class, function, or variable names. Avoid gratuitous prefixes or unnecessary context.
```python
# Good
class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city, state, zip_code):
        pass

# Bad
class GSDAddress:
    def __init__(self, gsd_street, gsd_city, gsd_state, gsd_zip_code):
        pass
```

### 1.8. Don’t Be Cute or Pun
- Avoid clever or humorous names that may not be clear to others.
```python
# Good
def delete_items():
    pass

# Bad
def holy_hand_grenade():
    pass
```

## 2. Functions
- Functions are the building blocks of clean code and should be small, focused, and descriptive.
- Strive for simplicity, eliminate duplication, and write code that reads like a well-structured narrative. Functions are not just code—they are the verbs of your domain-specific language.
  
### 2.1 Keep Functions Small
- Functions should be as short as possible. Ideally, they should fit within a few lines.
- Each function should perform one task only, focusing on clarity and brevity.
```python
# Good
def render_page(page_data):
    if is_test_page(page_data):
        include_setup_and_teardown_pages(page_data)
    return page_data.get_html()

# Bad
def render_page(page_data):
    if page_data.has_attribute("Test"):
        # Long, complex operations for setup and teardown
        setup_pages = fetch_setup_pages()
        teardown_pages = fetch_teardown_pages()
        page_data.set_content(setup_pages + page_data.get_content() + teardown_pages)
    return page_data.get_html()
```

### 2.2. Do One Thing
- Functions should do one thing and do it well. Avoid combining unrelated operations.
- If a function can be described with a single verb or action, it’s likely doing one thing.
```python
# Good
def include_setup_and_teardown_pages(page_data):
    include_setup_pages(page_data)
    include_teardown_pages(page_data)

# Bad
def include_pages(page_data):
    include_setup_pages(page_data)
    include_teardown_pages(page_data)
    render_html(page_data)
```

### 2.3. Use One Level of Abstraction
- Functions should stay at a single level of abstraction.
- Avoid mixing high-level logic with low-level details in the same function.
```python
# Good
def include_setup_pages(page_data):
    suite_setup = find_suite_setup(page_data)
    if suite_setup:
        append_setup(page_data, suite_setup)

# Bad
def include_setup_pages(page_data):
    suite_setup = PageCrawler.get_inherited_page("SuiteSetup", page_data.wiki_page)
    if suite_setup:
        setup_path = suite_setup.get_page_crawler().get_full_path(suite_setup)
        page_data.buffer.append(f"!include {PathParser.render(setup_path)}")
```

### 2.4. Use Descriptive Names
- Function names should clearly describe their purpose. Long, descriptive names are preferable to short, cryptic ones.
- Avoid ambiguous terms and ensure consistency across similar functions.
```python
# Good
def include_setup_pages():
    pass

# Bad
def process_setups():
    pass
```

### 2.5. Minimize Function Arguments
- Ideal number of arguments: 0 (niladic), 1 (monadic), or 2 (dyadic). Avoid triadic or polyadic arguments when possible.
- Use argument objects if more than two arguments are required.
```python
# Good
def create_circle(center, radius):
    pass

# Bad
def create_circle(x, y, radius):
    pass
```

### 2.6. Avoid Flag Arguments
- Flag arguments (e.g., `is_suite`) indicate a function is doing more than one thing. Split such functions into separate ones.
```python
# Good
def render_for_suite(page_data):
    pass

def render_for_test(page_data):
    pass

# Bad
def render_page(page_data, is_suite):
    pass
```

### 2.7. Separate Command and Query Functions
- Functions should either perform an action (command) or return information (query), but not both.
```python
# Good
if attribute_exists("username"):
    set_attribute("username", "john_doe")

# Bad
if set_attribute("username", "john_doe"):
    pass
```

### 2.8. Use Exceptions Instead of Error Codes
- Avoid returning error codes. Use exceptions to separate normal flow from error handling.
```python
# Good
try:
    delete_page(page)
except Exception as e:
    log_error(e)

# Bad
if delete_page(page) == "ERROR":
    log_error("Failed to delete page")
```

### 2.9. Avoid Duplication
- Eliminate repeated code by abstracting common logic into reusable functions.
```python
# Good
def include(page, type):
    page_path = fetch_page_path(type)
    if page_path:
        buffer.append(f"!include -{type} {page_path}")

# Bad
def include_setup_page():
    setup_path = fetch_setup_path()
    if setup_path:
        buffer.append(f"!include -setup {setup_path}")

def include_teardown_page():
    teardown_path = fetch_teardown_path()
    if teardown_path:
        buffer.append(f"!include -teardown {teardown_path}")
```

### 2.10. Error Handling is One Thing
- Functions that handle errors should do only that. Extract error-handling logic into separate functions.
```python
# Good
def delete_page_with_error_handling(page):
    try:
        delete_page(page)
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(e)

# Bad
def delete_page(page):
    try:
        # Delete logic
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(e)
```
